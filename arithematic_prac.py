# in arithematic we don't have only arithematic expressions but also some methods that returns value

# let's take 4 variables

x = 3.4
y = 4
z = -5

# some arithematic operations, remember the value chose above is totally random-> so no guarantee what you get as an answer
print(x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)
print(16 // y)
print(y % 3)
print(y ** 2)

# some methods that returns value: like abs, round, etc

print(abs(z))
print(round(x))

# now there are more to see, but first we will import math module( this generally be imported at the upper part of the code )

import math

print(math.pi) # this wil return the value of pi
print(math.e) # this wil return the value of exponential constant

# there are more methods available in math module like: floor, ceil, sqrt
